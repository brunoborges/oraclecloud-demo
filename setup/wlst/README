# WLST Scripts for Managing and Customizing WebLogic Instances
These scripts are used to add required resources by the application such as:

 - JDBC Data Sources
 - JMS Servers, Queues, Connection Factories
 - Security Realms

Modify jcs.properties with the corresponding information of your WebLogic or JCS instance.

The following scripts can be executed using the local wlst.sh from on premise WebLogic installation:

 - create-datasource.py
 - create-jms.py
 - create-security-realm.py
 - start-all-managedservers.py
 - stop-all-servers.py

The following script must be executed with an SSL Tunnel enabled, or properly adjusted to be executed with wlst-jcs.sh shell script:

 - start-admin.py
